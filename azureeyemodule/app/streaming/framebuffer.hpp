/**
 * A FrameBuffer represents a circular queue of frames to be sent out over RTSP.
 * When the frame would be empty, we just keep feeding out the last frame again and again.
 *
 * Getting a frame from the buffer does not remove it, instead, we maintain a rate
 * at which we want to change frames, and remove them at that rate. Every time
 * a client wants to get a frame from this buffer, we return the current frame.
 *
 * Therefore, this class can be read by multiple clients who all expect to get the same
 * information.
 *
 * Each framebuffer starts with a default frame, which will be what it sends out until
 * it gets something else.
 *
 * This is thread-safe. You can read and write to this concurrently.
 *
 * The rationale for this class is time alignment. If the neural network
 * wants to align its inferences in time, it needs to buffer up some number
 * of old raw frames until it gets a network inference. Then it goes
 * through the old frames to find the one that best matches in time
 * with the frame the network used to derive its inferences.
 * Once it finds the right frame, it marks up that frame and all older frames
 * with that information, then dumps all of those frames into this buffer.
 *
 * Without the need for time alignment, we could just have a single latest
 * frame, which would be updated every time we get a new one, which is
 * what we used to do.

     * @param max_length: The maximum number of frames to store in the buffer before old ones get written over.
     *                    If this number is too small, we may get a dump of frames from the neural network
     *                    of a longer length than we can handle. In that case, we will dump some of those frames
     *                    as we wrap around the buffer, creating a jump in time in the stream that is jarring
     *                    to the viewer.
     * @param fps: The frames per second at which to update the `get` frame. GStreamer RTSP server will call
     *             the `get()` method at some frames per second, which may be different than this, but if the
     *             FPS values differ, you might send duplicate frames or you might not send frames as often as
     *             you could. Best to make sure this value remains about the same rate as the camera which generates the frames.
